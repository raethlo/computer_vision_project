# Emotion recognition with OpenCV

This is a very raw work in progress draft of an emotion recognition attempt using the [Cohn-Kannade emotion labeled dataset.](http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/)
I have used the built in opencv FisherFace detection algorithm pretrained on the final expression CK+ images to detect emotions realtime from a webcam.
Worked fairly well but is mostly just a proof of concept that it is possible.
